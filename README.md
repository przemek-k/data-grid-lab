# Data Grid Lab

An illustrative example of a reimplementation of React's diffing algorithm in vanilla JavaScript. This project aims to provide insight into how virtual DOM diffing operates, using a simplified version written purely in JavaScript without relying on React.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Node.js installed on your system to use npm for managing dependencies and executing scripts defined in package.json.

### Installing

#### Clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/przemek-k/data-grid-lab.git
```

#### Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd data-grid-lab
```

#### Install the project dependencies:

```
npm install
```

### Development

To start the development server:

```
npm run dev
```

This command will bundle your JavaScript files using Webpack and serve them with webpack-dev-server. Your default web browser should automatically open to `http://localhost:3000`.

### Building

To build the project for production:

```
npm run build
```

This will generate a production build of your project in the `./public` directory, optimizing your code for performance.

### Usage

Start the local server to view your project:

```
npm start
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or the port indicated by serve) to view the application.

### Running the Tests

Currently, the project does not contain any tests:

```
npm test
```

This will output "Error: no test specified".
